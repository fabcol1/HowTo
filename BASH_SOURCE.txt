##### WHAT IS SOURCE ####################

source is a bash shell built-in command that executes the content of the file passed as argument, in the current shell. It has a synonym in . (period).

	. filename [arguments]

	source filename [arguments]

Be careful! ./ and source are not quite the same.

./script runs the script as an executable file, launching a new shell to run it...
source script reads and executes commands from filename in the current shell environment

Note: ./script is not . script, but . script == source script
